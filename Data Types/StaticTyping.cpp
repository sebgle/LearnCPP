/*
Static Typing
    - the data type of a variable is determined at compile time (before program is executed)
    -  the compiler ensures that the operations performed with the variable are compatible with its type
    - if there is a mismatch , the compiler will adjust the data type of variable to match another provided itâ€™s feasible, this is known as type conversion
    - else, invalid type conversion error will be raised during compilation
