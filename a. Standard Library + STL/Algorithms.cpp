    Sorting
        - arranging a sequence of elements in a specific order
        - std::sort
            - sorts a range of elements in non-descending order 
        - also std::stable_sort, partial_sort

    Searching
        - std::find, std::binary_search, std::find_if
        - std::find
            - find the iterator of the first occurrence of a given value in a range

    Modifying sequences
        - std::remove, replace, unique
        - std::remove
            - removes all instances of a value from a container within a range
            - doesn't resize container
