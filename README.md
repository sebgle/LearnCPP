# LearnCPP

Welcome to LearnCPP, where I document my journey of learning C++ using [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/).

## About

This repository contains my notes and sample code as I progress through the C++ roadmap. The goal is to thoroughly understand C++ and improve my coding skills in this language.

## Progress

You can follow my progress [here](https://roadmap.sh/cpp?s=66a7db00ee6a29a2ed051366).

## Contents

- **Notes:** Detailed explanations and summaries of key concepts and lessons.
- **Sample Code:** Examples and snippets demonstrating the application of various C++ concepts.

## Goals

1. To build a strong foundation in C++ programming.
2. To complete the C++ roadmap and apply the knowledge in practical scenarios.
3. To create a comprehensive resource of notes and sample code for future reference.
