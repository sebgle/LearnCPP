Structuring Codebase
    - an essential part of software development
    - organizing and modularizing your code 
    - maintainable, efficient, and easier to understand
    - enhances collaboration, simplifies adding new features, and makes debugging faster


    Techniques

        - Namespaces:
            - tools to organize your code
            - provides a named scope for different identifiers you create (functions, classes, variables)
            - help avoid name clashes and make code more modular

        - Include Guards:
            - tool for preventing multiple inclusions of a header file in your project
            - consists of preprocessor directives that conditionally include the header file only once

        - Header and Source Files:
            - separates implementation and declarations in header (.h) and source (.cpp) files
            - header files contain class and function declarations 
            - source files contain their definitions

        - Code formatting
            - consistent code formatting and indentation makes code easier to read and understand
            - follow style guides like Google C++ Style Guide
